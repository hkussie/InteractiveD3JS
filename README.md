This project uses the Javascript framework d3js, to take in csv data to model global defense spending.

reflect that. The user is presented with the totality of global defense spending (with regards to the top 30 largest spenders)
in the form of a bubble chart. The user is given the option to seperate which countries spend the most (based off of percentage 
of GDP) in the form of.
